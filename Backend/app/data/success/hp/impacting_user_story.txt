User Story: Enhanced Security Policy Management

As a system administrator
I want to implement configurable security policies for password management
So that we can enforce different security levels for different user groups

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Password Policy Configuration:
   - Admins should be able to configure password policies per user group:
     * Minimum and maximum password length (8-32 characters)
     * Required character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special)
     * Password expiration period (30-180 days)
     * Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse (3-10)
     * Maximum failed login attempts (3-10)
     * Account lockout duration (15-60 minutes)
     * Password change frequency limits (1-5 times per 24 hours)

2. User Group Management:
   - Create predefined security levels:
     * Basic (default settings)
     * Enhanced (stricter requirements)
     * Maximum (most stringent rules)
   - Ability to assign users to different security groups
   - Bulk update of security policies for user groups
   - Automatic policy enforcement based on user role

3. Password Validation Enhancements:
   - Add dictionary-based password validation
   - Check for common password patterns
   - Prevent using parts of email/username in password
   - Enforce minimum password age (prevent frequent changes)
   - Real-time password strength calculation using zxcvbn algorithm
   - Custom regex patterns for password validation

4. Security Notifications:
   - Notify users when:
     * Their security group is changed
     * Password policy is updated
     * Password is about to expire
     * Account is approaching maximum failed attempts
   - Configure notification frequency and methods
   - Support for email, SMS, and in-app notifications

5. Compliance and Reporting:
   - Generate reports on:
     * Password policy compliance by group
     * Failed login attempts
     * Password change patterns
     * Policy override instances
   - Export security audit logs
   - Track policy effectiveness metrics

Technical Requirements:
- Update password hashing to support configurable work factors
- Implement caching for frequently accessed policy rules
- Support gradual policy rollout to user groups
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing password rules
- API endpoints for policy management
- Real-time policy enforcement in the UI

Business Rules:
- Policy changes take effect on next password change
- Grace period for users to comply with new policies
- Emergency override process for administrators
- Automatic security level escalation based on user behavior
- Integration with existing IAM systems
- Support for regulatory compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)
