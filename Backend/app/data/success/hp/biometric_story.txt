User Story: Enhanced Biometric Authentication Integration

As a mobile app user
I want to use biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition) as my primary authentication method
So that I can securely access my account without entering passwords frequently

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Biometric Authentication Setup:
   - Users can enable biometric login from security settings
   - First-time biometric setup requires password verification
   - Support for multiple biometric types:
     * Fingerprint (TouchID)
     * Face Recognition (FaceID)
     * Windows Hello
     * Android Biometric API
   - Option to register multiple fingerprints/faces
   - Backup password option always available

2. Authentication Flow Changes:
   - Biometric authentication replaces password in daily login
   - Critical actions still require password verification:
     * Adding/removing biometric credentials
     * Changing security settings
     * Financial transactions above $1000
     * Accessing sensitive documents
   - Automatic fallback to password after 3 failed biometric attempts
   - Device-specific biometric settings

3. Security Enhancements:
   - Encrypted biometric token storage
   - Separate biometric and password authentication chains
   - Real-time biometric validation status
   - Anti-spoofing detection for face recognition
   - Liveness detection for fingerprint
   - Session management with biometric context
   - Automatic security level adjustment based on:
     * Device trust score
     * Biometric match confidence
     * Location risk assessment

4. Multi-Device Support:
   - Sync biometric settings across devices
   - Device-specific biometric preferences
   - Remote biometric access revocation
   - Automatic device trust scoring
   - Cross-platform biometric support:
     * iOS (TouchID/FaceID)
     * Android (Fingerprint/Face Unlock)
     * Windows (Windows Hello)
     * MacOS (TouchID)

5. Compliance & Audit:
   - Detailed audit logs for biometric events:
     * Enrollment attempts
     * Authentication successes/failures
     * Fallback to password instances
     * Device registration/removal
   - Privacy compliance features:
     * Biometric data retention policies
     * User consent management
     * Data anonymization
     * GDPR/CCPA compliance

Technical Requirements:
- Integration with native biometric APIs
- Secure biometric token management
- Real-time biometric validation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Encrypted communication channels
- Biometric template protection
- High-availability biometric services

Business Rules:
- Biometric authentication available only on trusted devices
- Maximum 5 registered biometric credentials per type
- 24-hour cooling period after failed biometric attempts
- Automatic notification for suspicious biometric activity
- Geographic location-based biometric restrictions
- Risk-based authentication stepping
- Regular biometric re-validation required
